_Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation_

A Python script to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques.

_Description_

This script applies a simple encryption algorithm to images by manipulating their pixels. It uses a combination of mathematical operations and pixel swapping to obscure the image content.

_Features_

- Encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation
- Applies mathematical operations (addition and subtraction) to pixel values
- Swaps pixels randomly based on a provided key

_Usage_

1. Run the script
2. Choose the mode (encrypt/decrypt)
3. Enter the input image path
4. Enter the output image path
5. Enter the encryption key (integer)

_Example_

Encrypting an image with key 10:
```
Mode: encrypt
Input: image.jpg
Output: encrypted_image.jpg
Key: 10
```

_Note_

This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for secure image encryption.
